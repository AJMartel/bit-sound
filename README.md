# The bits of the sound!
A simple tool to bring your midi files to life with an `Arduino uno` and `tone()` library. 

1. Easy interface
2. Completely written in JavaScript
3. It parses the `mid` file in the browser and it won't send it anywhere!
4. You can hear how the selected track in your midi file sounds!
5. Dedicated with ‚ù§ to the one who I love.
